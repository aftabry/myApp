This is my first ionic.js app 
to start from scratch please follow this

Install Ionic:

npm install -g cordova ionic

Windows Developers: We recommend Visual Studio Community, which comes with everything you need, including starter templates!

First, install Node.js. Then, install the latest Cordova and Ionic command-line tools in your terminal. Follow the Android and iOS platform guides to install required tools for development.
If youâ€™re new to the command line, read our Terminal tutorial
